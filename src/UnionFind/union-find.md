# Dynamic Connectivity

Given a set of n elements:

## Union Command
- **Union command**: Connect two objects.
- **Find**: Determine whether there is a path connecting two objects using reflexive, symmetric, or transitive properties.

## Demonstration of Dynamic connectivity | Modelling the connections
If I have 3 objects `p`, `q`, `r`, are they connected?
1. **Reflexive**: `p` is directly connected to `p`.
2. **Symmetric**: If `p` is connected to `q`, then `q` is connected to `p`.
3. **Transitive**: If `p` is connected to `q` and `q` is connected to `r`, then `p` is connected to `r`.
